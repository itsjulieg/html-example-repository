            <h2 id="1">Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The term “aesthetic” made its rise to fame on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and it has been used to describe one’s style or vibe. Many have used aesthetics to develop a sense of individuality among themselves. Aesthetics also incorporate certain color palettes, whether it’s bright pastel colors or shades of red and brown.</p>

        <p>Knitting and crocheting, for many years, have been considered “old lady” hobbies, but ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been hobbies that teenagers, young adults, and even kids have picked up. Many viral knit and crochet creations have been made since their popularity among these demographics, but we will only address the current knit and crochet pieces for this fall season. </p>
